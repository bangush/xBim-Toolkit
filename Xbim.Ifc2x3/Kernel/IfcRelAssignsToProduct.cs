    ///   Definition from IAI: This objectified relationship IfcRelAssignsToProduct handles the assignment of objects (subtypes of IfcObject) to a product (subtypes of IfcProduct). 
    ///   The Name attribute should be used to classify the usage of the IfcRelAssignsToProduct objectified relationship. The following Name values are proposed:
    ///   'Reference' : Assignment of a product (via RelatingProduct) to a spatial structure (via RelatedObjects) to which it is referenced (in contrary to being contained - which is handled by IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure). 
    ///   IFC2x Edition 3 CHANGE  The reference of a product within a spatial structure is now handled by a new relationship object IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure. The IfcRelAssignsToProduct shall not be used to represent this relation from IFC2x3 onwards.
    ///   'Context' : Assignment of a context specific representation, such as of structural members to a different context representation (with potentially different decomposition breakdown) such as of building elements for a specific context specific representation.  
    ///   IFC2x Edition 3 CHANGE  The relation of a structural member (as instance of IfcStructuralMember or its subclasses) to a physical element  (as instance of IfcElement or its subclasses) is now handled by a new relationship object IfcRelConnectsStructuralElement. The IfcRelAssignsToProduct shall not be used to represent this relation from IFC2x3 onwards.
    ///   'View' : Assignment of a product (via RelatingProduct) that is decomposed according to a discipline view, to another product (via RelatedObjects) that is decomposed according to a different discipline view. An example is the assignment of the architectural slab to a different decomposition of the pre manufactured sections of a slab (under a precast concrete discipline view).
