This project should work out of the box with 3 test models from the BuildingSmart Alliance (Duplex, Office and Clinic).

If you want to load other models, drop the .xbim and .xbimgc files into the models folder. 
They will then be available the next time the page is refreshed.

Controls:
Left click (hold) then drag will rotate the model.
Mousewheel will zoom in.
Right click (hold) and drag will pan the model.
Left Clicking an item will display the properties box for the item (not currently wired up to any data though).
Hovering over and item with the mouse and hitting the 'Delete' key on the keyboard will make the element invisible.

Visibility can also be controlled by the checkboxes in the Material Types tree.
