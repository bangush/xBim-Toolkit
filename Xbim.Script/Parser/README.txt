There are some changes to the parser:

GPPG parser and GPLEX scaner are newer then the ones used to parse IFC in Xbim.IO. 
Language used in this project is not compatible with the older version of the parser. 
To avoid name comflicts I have renamed namespace of ShiftReduceParces class. 
I have also changed code generation of the GPPG so that it keeps it right.
