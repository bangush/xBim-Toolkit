    ///   Definition from IAI: Any object, or any aid to define, organize and annotate an object, that relates to a geometric or spatial context. Subtypes of IfcProduct usually hold a shape representation and a local placement within the project structure. 
    ///   This includes manufactured, supplied or created objects (referred to as elements) for incorporation into an AEC/FM project. This also includes objects that are created indirectly by other products, as spaces are defined by bounding elements. Products can be designated for permanent use or temporary use, an example for the latter is formwork. Products are defined by their properties and representations.
    ///   In addition to physical products (covered by the subtype IfcElement) and spatial items (covered by the subtype IfcSpatialStructureElement) the IfcProduct also includes non-physical items, that relate to a geometric or spatial contexts, such as grid, port, annotation, structural actions, etc.

    ///   Use Definition
    ///   Any instance of IfcProduct defines a particular occurrence of a product, the common type information, that relates to many similar (or identical) occurrences of IfcProduct, is handled by the IfcTypeProduct (and its subtypes), assigned to one or many occurrences of IfcProduct by using the objectified relationship IfcRelDefinesByType. The IfcTypeProduct may provide, in addition to common properties, also a common geometric representation for all occurrences.
    ///   An IfcProduct occurs at a specific location in space if it has a geometric representation assigned. It can be placed relatively to other products, but ultimately relative to the world coordinate system defined for this project.
    ///   The inherited ObjectType attribute can be used to designate a particular type of the product instance. If subtypes of IfcProduct have a PredefinedType defined, the ObjectType is used to provide the user defined, particular type of the product instance, if the PredefinedType is set to USERDEFINED.
