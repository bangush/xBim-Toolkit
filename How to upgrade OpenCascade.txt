To upgrade OpenCascade

First download a complete OCC installation and compile all to Visual Studio 10

This is the the SRC directory

From the OpencascadeUpgrade branch
Check out of source control all files in the OpenCascade subdirectory of Xbim.ModelGeometry

This is the target directory

Check out all the binary dll files in the root bin directory

Make sure the src and target variables in the folowing two batch files are correct


UpgradeOCCinc and UpgradeOCClib

Run each of these batch files


These will copy the required subset of files to the target directory

Compile and hopefully all is well.....
